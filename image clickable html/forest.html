    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The forest painting depicts a lush green forest with a gentle stream flowing through it. The water sparkles in the sunlight as it winds its way through the rocks and over the small waterfall. The sun is shining down through the trees, casting dappled light patterns on the forest floor. The trees are in full bloom, with delicate leaves and flowers in shades of green and yellow, creating a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. The painting captures the essence of the forest in the springtime, with new growth, fresh air, and pure water. It invites the viewer to step into this serene natural world and soak in the beauty and calmness of the spring forest.</p>
