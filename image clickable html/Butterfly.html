    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A  blue butterfly painting depicts a beautiful butterfly with its wings with outer gold leafing layer.  The butterfly has a bright blue color, with a bit of white and black lines. The background is  painted with blue and white abstract form. The stroke of the brush used in this painting is light and delicate, creating a sense of movement and grace. This painting's overall effect is calming and soothing, just like the gentle flutter of a butterfly's wings.
